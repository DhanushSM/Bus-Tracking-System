# Bus Tracking System

## About the Project
The Bus Tracking System is a web-based application designed to track the real-time location of buses. This system aims to provide users with up-to-date information about bus locations, routes, and estimated arrival times. The primary goal is to enhance the commuting experience by providing reliable and accurate bus tracking information.

## How It Works
The Bus Tracking System works by integrating GPS tracking devices installed on buses with a web-based application. The key components and workflow are as follows:

1. **GPS Devices:** Each bus is equipped with a GPS tracking device that continuously sends location data to the server.
2. **Server:** The server receives the GPS data and processes it to determine the real-time location of each bus.
3. **Database:** The processed location data is stored in a database along with other relevant information such as bus routes and schedules.
4. **Web Application:** The front-end application retrieves the data from the server and displays it on a map. Users can view the real-time location of buses, their routes, and estimated arrival times.
5. **User Interface:** The user interface allows users to interact with the map, search for specific bus routes, and get detailed information about each bus.

## Installation
